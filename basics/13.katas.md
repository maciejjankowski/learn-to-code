## [Simple string reversal II](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a8d1c82373c2e099d0000ac)

In this Kata, you will be given a string and two indexes. Your task is to reverse the portion of that string between those two indices inclusive.

````py
solve("codewars",1,5) = "cawedors"
# elements at index 1 to 5 inclusive are "odewa". So we reverse them.
solve("cODEWArs", 1,5) = "cAWEDOrs"
# to help visualize.
````

Input will be lowercase and uppercase letters only. 


## [Simple remove duplicates](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5ba38ba180824a86850000f7)

In this Kata, you will remove the left-most duplicates from a list of integers and return the result.

```` 
# Remove the 3's at indices 0 and 3
# followed by removing a 4 at index 1
solve ([3, 4, 4, 3, 6, 3]) # => [4, 6, 3]
````


## [Reversed Strings](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5168bb5dfe9a00b126000018)

Complete the solution so that it reverses the string value passed into it.

    solution('world'); // returns 'dlrow'


## [Count the smiley faces!](https://www.codewars.com/kata/583203e6eb35d7980400002a)

Given an array (arr) as an argument complete the function countSmileys that should return the total number of smiling faces.

Rules for a smiling face:
* Each smiley face must contain a valid pair of eyes. Eyes can be marked as : or ;
* A smiley face can have a nose but it does not have to. Valid characters for a nose are - or ~
* Every smiling face must have a smiling mouth that should be marked with either ) or D.

No additional characters are allowed except for those mentioned.

Valid smiley face examples:
    :) :D ;-D :~)


Invalid smiley faces:
    ;( :> :} :]

Example cases:
````py
countSmileys([':)', ';(', ';}', ':-D']);       # should return 2;
countSmileys([';D', ':-(', ':-)', ';~)']);     # should return 3;
countSmileys([';]', ':[', ';*', ':$', ';-D']); # should return 1;
````

Note: In case of an empty array return 0. You will not be tested with invalid input (input will always be an array). Order of the face (eyes, nose, mouth) elements will always be the same 

## [Scrolling Text](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a995c2aba1bb57f660001fd)

Let's create some scrolling text!

Your task is to complete the function which takes a string, and returns an array with all possible rotations of the given string, in uppercase.

Example

````
scrollingText("codewars") should return:

[ "CODEWARS",
  "ODEWARSC",
  "DEWARSCO",
  "EWARSCOD",
  "WARSCODE",
  "ARSCODEW"
  "RSCODEWA",
  "SCODEWAR" ]
````

## [Cat years, Dog years](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a6663e9fd56cb5ab800008b)

I have a cat and a dog.

I got them at the same time as kitten/puppy. That was humanYears years ago.

Return their respective ages now as [humanYears,catYears, dogYears]

NOTES:

    humanYears >= 1
    humanYears are whole numbers only

Cat Years

    15 cat years for first year
    +9 cat years for second year
    +4 cat years for each year after that

Dog Years

    15 dog years for first year
    +9 dog years for second year
    +5 dog years for each year after that

## [Reversed Words](https://www.codewars.com/kata/51c8991dee245d7ddf00000e)

Complete the solution so that it reverses all of the words within the string passed in.

Example:

````py
solution("The greatest victory is that which requires no battle") 
# should return "battle no requires which that is victory greatest The"
````

## [Simple string reversal](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a71939d373c2e634200008e)

In this Kata, we are going to reverse a string while maintaining spaces.

For example:

````py
solve("our code") = "edo cruo"
# Normal reversal without spaces is "edocruo". 
# However, there is a space after the first three characters, hence "edo cruo"

solve("your code rocks") = "skco redo cruoy"
solve("codewars") = "srawedoc"
````
