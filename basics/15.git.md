# Git intro

Git is a version control system. It's helping you track changes to your project files and helps easily add, revert and move between different versions

## Start working on a project
### Blank project (not on github)
git init
### existing project already on github:
git clone <url>

## Check what files were changed
git status

## Check what changes were made in those files
git diff

## Add changes to the new snapshot
git add

## "Save" the current snapshot with a given comment
git commit -m "comment text"

## Transfer new changes to the remote server (github)
git push

## Pull the recent changes from the remote server
git pull

## View the list of commits
git log

## Reset changes to the specified snapshot

git revert
